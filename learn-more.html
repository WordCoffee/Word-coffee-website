    <h2>Why Words Matter</h2>
    <p>
      From ancient mantras to modern mantras, words have always been powerful tools of transformation. At Word Coffee, we believe words can shift moods, shape identities, and rewire thought patterns. We're not just selling cards—we're sharing a tool for growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation and the Mind</h2>
    <p>
      Motivation isn’t a one-time push—it’s a habit. Studies in behavioral psychology show that small affirmations, practiced daily, reinforce positive mental frameworks. Whether written, spoken, or read silently, intentional phrases can reduce stress, increase focus, and build emotional resilience.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Science Says</h2>
    <p>
      Research in neuroscience supports this: repeating positive affirmations engages areas of the brain associated with self-perception and valuation. That means the more you practice affirming your worth, your goals, or your growth, the more your brain begins to believe it.
    </p>

    <h2>Everyday Rituals of Power</h2>
    <p>
      Like morning coffee, our cards are a ritual. A moment of peace before the rush. A quick breath between chaos. They give shape to intention. Whether you’re a mother navigating a full household or a woman climbing new personal heights, these words are meant to support, inspire, and ground you.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bigger Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Word Coffee is more than a product. It’s a platform designed to grow into workshops, a speaker series, and a global community of empowered thinkers. We're building tools for mental wellness, for creativity, for courage—and this is just the beginning. If you’ve ever needed a reason to believe in your next step, we hope Word Coffee gives you that nudge.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to make empowerment accessible and genuine. With each word, we want you to feel seen. With each phrase, we want to shift your day. We’re here to help you pause, reset, and rise.
