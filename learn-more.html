    <h2>The Power of Words</h2>
    <p>At Word Coffee, we believe words are more than just communication—they are catalysts for change. A single phrase has the power to uplift, motivate, comfort, or completely shift a mindset. Our mission is rooted in one simple truth: what we say to ourselves shapes who we become.</p>

    <h2>The Science Behind Affirmations</h2>
    <p>Affirmations aren’t wishful thinking—they’re grounded in neuroscience. Research in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and self-affirmation theory shows that repeating positive phrases can help rewire our brain’s default mode of thinking. MRI studies have demonstrated that affirmations activate reward centers in the brain, building neural pathways that reinforce positive self-identity and resilience.</p>

    <h2>Daily Rituals That Stick</h2>
    <p>Motivation isn’t about sudden inspiration—it’s built from consistency. By placing powerful messages where you start your day (like a card next to your coffee), you embed meaningful intention into your routine. It’s simple, visual, and powerful. Think of it as fuel before your first sip.</p>

    <h2>The Emotional Lift</h2>
    <p>Life is noisy. Between tasks, goals, and responsibilities, it’s easy to lose touch with our inner voice. Word Coffee’s affirmations are your reminder that your value is not in productivity alone, but in your perseverance, your heart, and your intention. These cards are not about perfection—they’re about perspective.</p>
