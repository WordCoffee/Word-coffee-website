    <h2>1. How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Word Coffee operates on the principle that small, intentional moments of reflection can produce lasting change. Each card offers a simple word or phrase designed to spark thought, affirm self-worth, or redirect focus. The act of drawing a card becomes a grounding ritual that centers your day with purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Science Behind It</h2>
    <p>
      Numerous studies in neuroscience and psychology confirm that positive affirmations can activate the brain’s reward system, improve emotional regulation, and reduce the impact of stress. Our brains form new neural pathways with repeated thoughts—a phenomenon called neuroplasticity. Word Coffee leverages this to encourage healthier self-talk and belief systems.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Backed by Research</h2>
    <p>
      Academic research supports the benefits of affirmations and positive words. For example, a study in the journal "Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience" found that self-affirmation activates brain systems associated with self-processing and valuation. Another study published by the APA highlighted improved academic performance and reduced stress among students using regular affirmations.
    </p>

    <h2>4. The Power of Affirmations</h2>
    <p>
      Affirmations work by planting seeds of confidence, resilience, and hope. When spoken or read regularly, they serve as reminders of one's potential and inner strength. Word Coffee cards are built to deliver that message—short, digestible, but impactful, like a shot of espresso for your mindset.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Behind the Brand</h2>
    <p>
      Word Coffee is more than just cards—it’s a growing movement. Created to give people tools for daily motivation, it’s rooted in simplicity, beauty, and function. As we expand, we aim to offer more experiences: workshops, speaker events, and thoughtful content that empower users to lead with courage and clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Intentional Living</h2>
    <p>
      Intentional living means choosing how you show up in the world, rather than moving through life on autopilot. Word Coffee acts as a daily reminder to pause, reflect, and engage with your values. Whether you’re a mom, professional, or simply someone navigating life’s complexity, this brand gives you a moment of stillness and strength.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Mindful Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Our approach combines mindfulness with simplicity. The cards are made for real life—they fit in your bag, sit by your desk, or start your morning routine. You don’t need hours of meditation or a perfect routine to benefit. Word Coffee is here to meet you exactly where you are.
