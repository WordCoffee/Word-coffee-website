      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Word Coffee was born from the belief that words—just like coffee—have the power to energize, heal, and transform. On our hardest mornings, it wasn't the caffeine alone that pulled us up, but the words we repeated to ourselves: "You can do this." What started as simple, handwritten affirmations has grown into a brand committed to helping others rise with intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that stress, self-doubt, and burnout are real—and constant. Word Coffee exists to remind you that your mindset is one of your greatest tools. A single, thoughtful message can create clarity. A spark of encouragement can change your day.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We’re Just Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        While our roots are in motivational cards, Word Coffee is a movement in the making. We're building more than a product—we’re cultivating a platform for self-expression, inner peace, and empowerment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the near future, Word Coffee will expand into live speaking events, personal development tools, and creative collaborations that help people reconnect with their voice. Imagine opening your morning with a card, then ending your week inspired by someone who’s walked a similar path. That’s the vision we’re brewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re a mom navigating chaos, a woman leading with grace, or simply someone looking for more intention in your life—Word Coffee was made for you. And this is just the beginning.

      <h2>Why Customers Are Excited</h2>
      <p>
        Because it’s not just about buying a card. It’s about feeling seen. It’s about gifting hope. It’s about starting conversations and turning routines into rituals. Our community is full of real people who crave depth, direction, and something meaningful to carry with them—on their fridge, in their journal, or even tucked in a lunchbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our early supporters are already sharing stories of how a single phrase changed their outlook. Imagine what’s possible as this movement grows.
