    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Word Coffee was created with a simple belief: the right words, delivered at the right moment, can change everything. Just like a warm cup of coffee revives the body, our cards recharge the mind—grounding you in presence, purpose, and power.</p>

    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>In a world filled with noise, we needed clarity. Between burnout and busyness, we found that moments of reflection were often overlooked. Word Coffee was born from that need—a tangible way to pause and remember who you are and where you're going.</p>

    <h2>The Future of Word Coffee</h2>
    <p>We’re building more than just card decks—we’re building a movement. From new editions and journals to live workshops and mobile tools, Word Coffee is becoming your companion in intentional living and inspired action.</p>

    <p>Our mission is simple: help people ground themselves in truth, one word at a time. Whether you're a mom navigating chaos, a professional chasing goals, or someone learning to love yourself more each day—we’re here for you.</p>
