    Motivation, One Word at a Time

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Word Coffee started as a simple idea: What if your daily boost of energy wasn’t just from caffeine, but from the words you surround yourself with? We believe in the power of small affirmations, heartfelt motivation, and meaningful reminders. What began as scribbled notes on coffee cups grew into a community of purpose-driven individuals looking to wake up not just physically—but emotionally and mentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to inspire moments of reflection, courage, and clarity through beautifully designed motivational cards. Whether you're a mom juggling chaos or a woman chasing a dream—or just someone trying to get through Monday—we’re here for that extra spark.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in the strength of a single word. That motivation doesn’t always come from loud speeches—it can come from a sentence on your desk, a whisper of hope when you need it most. Word Coffee exists to be that daily nudge toward your best self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our cards are more than just products—they're an experience. A ritual. A dose of caffeine for the soul.
