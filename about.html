    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Word Coffee was created with a simple idea in mind: that words have power. In the same way a warm cup of coffee can recharge your body, the right words can invigorate your mind. Whether you’re facing a tough day, building a new habit, or just need a spark of encouragement—our cards are designed to energize you.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>
      In a fast-paced, overstimulated world, many of us forget to take a breath—to reset and refocus on what matters. We saw a need for accessible, tangible motivation that could cut through the noise. Word Coffee was born out of that gap. It’s not just about affirmation—it’s about attention, presence, and turning intention into action.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future of Word Coffee</h2>
    <p>
      We envision Word Coffee growing beyond cards. We're working toward becoming a full platform for inspiration and personal growth—with upcoming launches like workshops, speaker events, and digital tools that help reinforce positive mindset habits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our long-term mission is to help create a more resilient and mindful culture—one word at a time. Whether you’re a mom navigating daily chaos, a professional chasing big dreams, or someone learning to love yourself a little more each day, Word Coffee is here for you.
