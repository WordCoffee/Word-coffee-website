    <p>Word Coffee began as a heartfelt idea: that words, like coffee, could give us a boost exactly when we need it. We've turned that belief into beautifully designed affirmation cards to support women and moms in their everyday journeys.</p>
    <p>We’re a small business with a big mission—to empower you with strength, humor, and daily motivation.</p>
