    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Word Coffee started with a simple belief: words can wake you up. Just like a great cup of coffee, the right phrase can reset your mindset, reignite your momentum, and help you move forward with clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>
      In a world filled with noise, we wanted to offer intentional moments of focus and motivation. Word Coffee isn’t just about affirmations—it’s about turning words into daily grounding rituals.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>
      We’re building a movement—expanding from card decks into journals, workshops, events, and digital tools that inspire bold living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re a parent, a dreamer, or just someone doing your best, Word Coffee was made for you.
