    <h2>About Word Coffee</h2>
    <p>
      Word Coffee started with a simple idea: that words, when used intentionally, can be just as energizing as a cup of coffee.
      We believe in the power of affirmations and motivational language to influence the way we think, feel, and act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed for moms, women, and anyone looking to bring mindfulness into their day, Word Coffee offers curated decks of affirmation cards
      and content aimed at uplifting your spirit in just a few seconds. These aren’t just words—they’re your morning boost, your midday anchor, your evening exhale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission extends beyond cards. We’re working toward becoming a broader motivational platform—one that could one day include events,
      workshops, and even a public speaking network centered on positivity and empowerment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand the deeper impact of affirmations and motivational practices, check out our <a href="informational.html">Informational</a> page,
      which includes insights, research, and tools for putting motivation into action.
